## Configuration details

This directory is intended to be used with VSCode and the ObjectScript extension. It uses a local VM of 2020.3 with a preview for IntegratedML. This is only needed for the last demo.

The Hash for the default password "Roche" has been added to the iris.cpf, which gets merged into the iris.cpf during the first strat of the instance.
